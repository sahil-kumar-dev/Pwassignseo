Question: What are the benefits of using meta tag ?

Answer: benefits of using meta tags are:-

Social Media Sharing: Meta tags like the Open Graph Protocol tags allow developers to control how web
pages are displayed when shared on social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn. They define
the title, description, and image that appear in social media posts, making shared links more attractive and
informative.

Viewport Control: The viewport meta tag is crucial for responsive web design. It allows developers to set the
initial scale and width of the viewport, making sure the webpage adapts well to different screen sizes and
resolutions.

Web Accessibility: Certain meta tags can improve web accessibility by providing additional information to
assistive technologies, making it easier for users with disabilities to navigate and understand the content.
